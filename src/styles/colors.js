/*A primary color is the color displayed most frequently
 across your app’s screens and components. It can also be used to accent elements,
 if you don’t have a secondary color. To create contrast between elements,
 you can use lighter or darker tones of your primary color.
 The contrast between lighter and darker tones helps show division between surfaces,
 such as between the status bar and a toolbar. */
